        <h1>Energy from water</h1>
        <p>Here you will find some information about the energy produced with water</p>

                <h2>Rain Power</h2>
            </div>
            <img class="img_right" src="images/splar-power-rain.jpg" alt="Rain Power" width="600" height="400">  
            <p class="p_left">There may not be a lot of energy in a falling raindrop—otherwise they’d surely hurt. But French scientists have figured out a way to harness what’s available. A team at the French Atomic Energy Commission built a device using a special plastic that converts the vibrational energy of a raindrop hitting it into electricity. Such an invention couldn’t produce a lot of power: a downpour generated up to 12 milliwatts, or enough to power a couple standard laser pointers. But the system would have an advantage over solar, as it would work in the dark and, of course, in a rainstorm.</p>

                <h2>Hydrogen Fuel</h2>
            </div>
            <img class="img_left" src="images/hydrogen-fuel-cell-testing-hero.jpg" alt="Hydrogen Fuel" width="600" height="400"> 
            <p class="p_right">Hydrogen fuel is a zero-emission fuel burned with oxygen. It can be used in fuel cells or internal combustion engines. It has begun to be used in commercial fuel cell vehicles such as passenger cars, and has been used in fuel cell buses for many years. It is also used as a fuel for spacecraft propulsion. With a device called a fuel cell, hydrogen can be turned into electricity. But even though the element is abundant, getting pure hydrogen alone has long been a challenge. Today, nearly all the world’s supply comes from fossil fuels, mostly natural gas. Researchers, however, have been working on ways to split hydrogen from water without using more energy than the fuel cell can produce. Some projects, for example, are exploring bacteria and solar-thermal techniques.</p>
            <div class="h1">
                <h2>Seawater-derived Jet Fuel</h2>
            </div>
            <img class="img_right" src="images/1-s2.0-S0045653513016135-fx1.jpg" alt="Seawater-derived Jet Fuel" width="600" height="400"> 
            
            <p class="p_left">In a more extreme twist on hydrogen power, the U.S. Navy announced earlier this year that they have developed a method for turning seawater into jet fuel. The process begins by using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Then the hydrogen is combined with carbon dioxide that had been dissolved in the water to produce a hydrocarbon, aka jet fuel. But anyone looking to the oceans as a solution to all our energy problems will be disappointed. The process is energy-intensive and really only an option if you’ve got a nuclear-powered ship on hand and need jets in the air more than electricity on deck. Heather Willauer, the navy chemist leading the project, says the efficiency needs to be much improved, perhaps by finding a different catalyst.</p>

                <h2>Solar-Wind Hybrid</h2>
            </div>
            <img class="img_left" src="images/Brasil_Pernambuco_Hibrida-1024x461.jpg" alt="Seawater-derived Jet Fuel" width="600" height="400">
            <p class=p_right>In much of the United States, wind speeds are low in the summer when the sun shines brightest and longest. The wind is strong in the winter when less sunlight is available. Because the peak operating times for wind and solar systems occur at different times of the day and year, hybrid systems are more likely to produce power when you need it. Build a really tall tower with an upper lip, then blow a fine mist of water over that lip. The mist absorbs heat from the air and evaporates. That results in cool, dense air flowing to the bottom of the structure, where it gets diverted through huge wind turbines that produce electricity. This method, which was patented back in 1975, works best in hot, arid places and requires a lot of water. It will finally get its first test in 2018, with a tower taller than the Empire State Building slated for construction in Arizona.</p>
